# CatYummy

## Capstone Project of the IT bootcamp at neuefische

CatYummy allows you to track your cat's decisions about its food. After adding the food, your cat likes or not, CatYummy will help your memory out when you will stand in front of a long row with cat food products next time, trying to remember which food your cat has already tested...and didn' t like it. It will save your money, helps to reduce waste and makes your cat happier.

CatYummy is under construction.
