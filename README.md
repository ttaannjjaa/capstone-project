# CatYummy

## Capstone Project of the IT bootcamp at neuefische

CatYummy allows you to track your cat's decisions about its food. After adding the food your cat likes or does not, CatYummy will help your memory out next time when you will stand in front of a long row with cat food products in the supermarket or pet supplies shop, trying to remember which food your cat has already tested...and didn' t like it. CatYummy will save your money, helps to reduce waste and makes your cat happier.

CatYummy is under construction.

So far there are three pages you can visit. A good start is the form to add another listcontent according to how your cat accepted the last food you gave to it. You can now see the new listitem on the according page. The data are stored in the local storage of your browser, so the app will (most probably) not loose them, when you reload or re-open the app. The newest feature is that i added a searchbar in the list of not liked food, so you can search for catfood (you have already added) with its name, taste or its preparation without scrolling along the whole list.
