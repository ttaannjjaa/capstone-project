# CatYummy

## Capstone Project of the IT bootcamp at neuefische

CatYummy allows you to track your cat's decisions about its food. After adding the food, your cat likes or not, CatYummy will help your memory out when you will stand in front of a long row with cat food products of the supermarket or pet shop next time, trying to remember which food your cat has already tested...and didn' t like it. It will save your money, helps to reduce waste and makes your cat happier.

CatYummy is under construction.
So far there are three pages you can visit. A good start is the form to add another listcontent according to how your cat accepted the last food you gave to it. You can now see the new listitem on the according page. The data are stored in the local storage of your browser, so the app will (most probably) not loose them, when you reload or re-open the app.
